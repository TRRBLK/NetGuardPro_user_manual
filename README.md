## Technical Architecture

NetGuard Pro is built on a distributed, modular architecture designed for performance, security, and scalability. Its components work together to provide real-time visibility, intelligent automation, and seamless integration with complex environments.

### Core Components

**Monitoring Engine**  
Collects and analyzes traffic across L2–L7, identifying anomalies, performance degradation, and unauthorized activity.

**Policy Engine**  
Applies dynamic rules based on devices, applications, or network segments with real-time impact analysis.

**Event Correlation System**  
Combines events into meaningful patterns to uncover security incidents or operational issues.

**Alerting Layer**  
Generates prioritized alerts with integrations for Slack, PagerDuty, SIEMs, or custom webhooks.

**Load Balancing & Optimization Layer**  
Distributes traffic efficiently, improves throughput, and reduces latency using predictive analysis.

**Distributed Node Architecture**  
Local nodes capture and process traffic securely, communicating with the controller via TLS 1.3.

**Cloud Integration Layer**  
Connects natively with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to enable hybrid or multi-cloud deployments.

### How It Works Internally

1. Nodes capture and preprocess traffic.  
2. Data is normalized and analyzed.  
3. Correlation identifies patterns and anomalies.  
4. Policies are applied dynamically.  
5. Events flow into dashboards and integrations.  
6. Optimization modules rebalance load when needed.
